I testes this project only from windows 10. If you have windows 11 or another os, maybe you have to go a different way.

if you know how to use node.js
install the node.js
start server.js file from node.js

if you don't know how to use node.js, then you should learn node.js first.


based node.js modules
--npm
--express
--ccxt
--ws
